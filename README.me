#TMDb Movies DataSet

I investigated the TMDb Dataset as my first Project in line with Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree requirements.

The Movie Dataset frm TMDb is a movie database that contains 10, 866 ros and 21 column with data on movies going as far back as 1960. The data from TMDb contains a lot on movies, casts, directors an dproduction companies and obviously not forgetting the money number behind the movie itself. Money numbers ranging from budget to revenue and the adjusted revenue and budget etc.

In this presentation analysis, I would be tackling some of the questions i found intersting. Such questions are: Which Genres are more popular from year to year? What kind of properties are associated with Higher Revenues? Then it was time to talk about the top movies based on a range of attributes. Properties such as Revenue, Budget, Popularity, Average Votes and most importantly Profit
